# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Streamlit App)

A **Machine Learning** project that predicts house prices based on property features like **area**, **bedrooms**, **bathrooms**, **stories**, and **parking**.  
This project uses **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** to create a simple interactive app for local use.

---

## 📌 Features
- Predicts house prices using a trained **Linear Regression** model
- Simple and easy-to-use **Streamlit** interface
- Uses **5 numeric inputs** for prediction
- Runs entirely on localhost — no deployment needed

---

## 📊 How It Works

### **Training**
- Loads the dataset (`Housing.csv`)
- Uses **Linear Regression** with data scaling
- Saves the trained model as a `.pkl` file

### **Prediction**
- User enters details (**area**, **bedrooms**, **bathrooms**, **stories**, **parking**)
- The app scales inputs and predicts the price
- Displays result instantly
